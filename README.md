# Connect - X 

Hey, welcome to this repo. This is exploartion of the Kaggle Connect-X open competition which tasks competitors to create an agent to play Connect 4. Agents which are not updated for more than 2 months are removed to ensure that agents are being constantly improved.

## Overview

### Focus
My focus on this project is on showing the efficiacy of deep reinforcement learning my making increasingly effective agents. After a while, I should explore the working of AlphaZero, to create a 100% winning agent. This type of agent is not always guranteed for these kind of problems but discussions in the compettition give evidence for a complete solution here.  
Important Checks 
- [x] Is the webiste accessible? (Check)
- [x] Is the final user interface easy to interact with? (Check)
- [x] Has all code been refactored to ease maintanence and readability? (Check)
- [ ] Have CSS adjustments been made to the code for different browsers?
