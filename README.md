## Overview

### :bug: Intro

This project is inspired by the Kaggle Connect-X comptetition, which tasked competitors to create agents to play the classic Connect 4 game. 
If haven't played before, Connext 4 is two player game where players take turns to drop coloured discs into a vertical grid. Each player uses has their own colour disc and the winner is the first player to make a line of four discs of their own colour. 




























My focus on this project is on showing the efficiacy of deep reinforcement learning my making increasingly effective agents. After a while, I should explore the working of AlphaZero, to create a 100% winning agent. This type of agent is not always guranteed for these kind of problems but discussions in the compettition give evidence for a complete solution here.
